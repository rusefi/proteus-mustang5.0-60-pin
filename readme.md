# 5.0 Mustang Proteus PnP
PnP adapter board for 5.0 mustang EEC-IV computer using Proteus Rusefi v0.5 compatible board.

This board is designed as both a PnP stock replacement for the A9L/A9P EECs found in 5.0 manual foxbody mustangs, as well as a fully featured aftermarket ECU. This board is designed to fit into BOTH versions of the stock Ford EEC-IV case.

PLEASE do not rip apart any A9L computers to house this unit, there's very few of them left and they sell for a lot! Keep or sell that and buy any late 80s to early 90s EEC-IV as a donor instead such as 88 ford taurus 2.4 EEC for $25.

wiki and more info coming after fully tested.
